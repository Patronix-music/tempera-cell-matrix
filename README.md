🟢 Matrix playback outline now stays nicely in sync, even with fast retriggering.
⌨️ Playback is much more solid when navigating with Tab, Arrow keys and Space (matrix + editors).
💬 Tooltips fully rebuilt — no more laggy or stuck browser tooltips.
🎚️ Fade in/out sliders now scale correctly with the actual sample length.
🧹 Header cleaned up to make room for the scrollbar control.
🎛️ Wave & Slice editor UI cleaned up, with help moved to the Help page (? for help, X to close).
